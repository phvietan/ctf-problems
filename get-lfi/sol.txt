Go to the page, the page hint that no one can find the "secret-directory" even Google

=> Think of robots.txt. I even put the embeded youtube video of Mr.Robot theme for fun (Robot)

Go to /robots.txt

We'll see:
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /flagflagflagflag
    Disallow: /flagpassword

Go to /flagflagflagflag and we see that it requires a username and password

Go to /flagpassword it says that we must come from /flagflagflagflag

But it should be impossible because we must have password first, but we can add Referer header when we move to /flagpassword

The username = hcmus_society
The password = youhavedonewellyoungone

Put it to /flagflagflagflag and get the flag
